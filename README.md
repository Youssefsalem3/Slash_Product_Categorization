# **Slash_Product_Categorization**

## **Problem definition**

So the task is to build a Prodct Categorization model that can take the image of the product and predict it's category for example i give you a tshirt and you say its from fashion items but for
a keychain this one is considered a stationary item.

I will be playing with three main categories for the task ( Fashion - Accessories - Stationary ) 

Now let's get into the phases !

## **Phase 1 : Data Collection**

The problem had no dataset but we were asked to take some screenshots go more advanced so after some thinking i found out a good way to collect data faster than taking screenshots
which was scraping but slash is still an mobile application so after many tries i failed to scrap Slash yet i found another way!

Now Slash shows the brand of each product for example i can see a notebook by Dawenha so i decided to scrap dawenha instagram page for some pictures for stationary items and so on
Till i collected roughly 200 images for each category which would have taken sometime if i kept screenshoting.
